               <h4>What I like about Computer Science</h4>
               <hr>
               <p>
                  Computer science has helped me improve my problem solving skills, creativity and knowledge. Computer science provides many areas of focus, which in return there is
                  many tools and resources that help develop and implement solutions to problems related to fields such as databases, natural language processing,
                  human-computer interaction, robotics, computational biology and bioinformatics. 
                  Computer science continues to grow, this allows me continually learn more about topics in computer science. Creating applications is very fun for me as well, I can create
                  applications on my own that can be used to help someone. Computer science has also helped me understand how software and computers work in the lower-level. Learning about how 
                  the software and hardware work has also helped me develop more efficient, secure and reliable software.

               <h4>Programming Languages</h4>
               <hr>
               <p>
               <h4>Java <img src="/staticFiles/images/java-icon.png" alt="Java Icon" height="24" width="24"></h4></h4>
               The programming language I am more experienced with is Java. Java has been in use for a long time and it 
               is compatible with most types of computers and phones.
               With Java I can build android applications, web applications, software tools and scientific applications.
               Learning about in OOP with Java helped me become a better problem solver using programming. In OOP we break 
               down a big problem into smaller problems, the solutions from this 
               can be used to solve the next problem.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <h4>Python <img src="/staticFiles/images/python-icon.png" alt="Python Icon" height="24" width="24"></h4>
               Another programming language I have experience with is Python. Python can be used for web development, machine learning,
               data analysis, data visualization and task automation. Python's ease of comprehension has helped me enjoy using Python to solve
               problems. Python also has countless open source libraries that can be used for many projects. I learned about Machine Learning 
               with Python, this can be used in companies to create decision support apps, customer recommendation engines, which in return 
               can benefit the company and its customers.
               </p>
               <p>
               <h4>Other Programming Languages</h4>
               I enjoy to learn about programming languages when I have time. I learn about different programming languages so that I can use 
               the optimal language to get to solution I am looking for. 
               Ada is a programming language I am currently studying, it can be used to develop real-time control systems for companies such as 
               Boeing for ensuring safe and efficient flight operations. Ada is also an important language for applications that require safety-critical 
               software. For database programming I have experience with SQL, PL/SQL and MongoDB. Data is the core component for many applications, 
               learning how to store, manage and retrieve data properly is important for developing an efficient and reliable application.

               <h5>How I Learn</h5>
               <hr>
               <p> 
                  To learn about software, I like to reverse engineer software to understand the design, architecture and functionality. I do this by reviewing an applications code, components
                  and behavior, using this information I can make a model of the application or system such as a class diagram to represent relationships, associations and how other various components
                  interact with each other to make the application work. Models like this can help stakeholders understand the functionality of a application.
               </p>
               <p> 
                  Immersive learning has helped me become more tenacious when learning about a new topic in computer science or programming language. Using immersive learning I get hands on experience with
                  a new topic, and my practical skills and critical thinking also improve with hands on experience. This has helped me not be discouraged when learning a topic that seems 
                  difficult, overall I enjoy to learn about knew things in computer science with hands on experience and using this experience to create solutions for problems.

               <h5>My Goals</h5>
               <hr>
               <p>
                  My first goal is to complete my bachelors degree in computer science. After I graduate I will try to get a deeper understading of topics in computer science such as computer security, 
                  cryptography, databases and data management. Knowledge of how to work with databases is important, databases support many aspects of modern life from healthcare, ecommerce and social media.
                  I have always been intrested in learning about how hackers can exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems, this will help me develop applications that can help prevent these attacks.
               </p>
               <p> 
                  I want to become more profficient with Python programming, to do this I have been working with Python more to develop pratical desktop applications
                  to understand more programming fundamentals. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  For databases I have been studying the Oracle database, the Oracle database is widely used by many organizations. Oracle db is useful for handling large amounts of data,
                  and is optimized for high-performance computing, it has features such as in-memory processing, parallel processing, and query optimization, these attributes 
                  can improve the performance of an application and improve the time it takes for data analysis and processing.
